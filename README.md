# Project Title
Transit Talk BCIT

## 1. Project Description
State your app in a nutshell, or one-sentence pitch. Give some elaboration on what the core features are.  
Our team, team 21, is developing a web app called Transit Talk BCIT to help BCIT commuters easily share and receive info about the conditions of nearby roads and bus loops by posting and searching for multimedia posts with filters such as location or type- unlike Google Maps, we will focus on BCIT and its direct routes.
